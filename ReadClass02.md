This topic matters how building a pc can save you money and change the experience of how you use it.

## Which is better in a CPU, more cores or higher speed? Under which circumstances is that true? How many CPU cores does a computer need?
- I mean both are good, but if you are handling many applications I would have more cores for better performance.
- If you don't work on many applications and want best speed I would choose higher processor speed.
- Usually 4-6 cores, but if your building a high end gaming pc then 6 cores or higher is reccomended.
  
## What details are you looking for when finding a motherboard which fits your processor?
- First you look by checking the socket of CPU and motherboard. Also the recommended brand of CPU for motherboard that you are looking or vice versa.
  
## What are the tradeoffs you’d evaluate while selecting a storage device?
- The size, speed, and price is the tradeoff. Cheapest would be a HDD which is not a reliable since it has moving parts. SSD are the middle ground but needs air cooling to main proper temperture. NVMe or M.2 are fast and expensive compared to the others and I would say its more reliable since it has no moving parts.

## Think about others with a background similar to yours. How would you explain to them the key parts of a computer, in a way they’d best connect with?
- You need all the neccesary parts of a computer depending on your budget and plan to use for.
- You need a CPU which is acts as a brain for your computer.
- A Motherboard which interacts between all of your components.
