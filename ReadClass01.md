This topic matters how a small chip in any electronic can help find information and alter the instructions in a malicious way.

 ##   How is a hardware hack different than a software hack?
- Attackers have to be onsite to have physical access and execute hardware hacking
- Attackers who software hack can lock out user or steal data from far away from the user

 ##   What are the two ways for spies to alter a computerâ€™s hardware?
- One is called interdiction which consists of manipulating devices as they are sent from the manufacturer to customer.
 - Second method is the changing the seed from the beginning.
 ##   Explain how the hack worked.
- When servers were ship across China to America, spies from China implemented a very small chip onto devices such as Supermicro servers which was possibly gathering, communicating, altering,  information through its hardware hack. This cause a lot of trouble and tension between American companies and Chinese Manufacturers. Increasing its risk through contracting American electronics being ship and made in China.
 ##  How were investigators able to trace the chips back to the source?
- When the investigators found these malicious microchips on Supermicro servers, they stated that these chips allegedly implanted by Chinese spies to infiltrate American networks. They believe that China let these spies meddle in it factories who makes Supermicro servers or any other American electronic and implemented their microchip onto American hardware.

## Things I want to know more about
- I wonder who exactly implemented those microchips.
- Is the Chinese Government breaking its own laws just to gain and steal information?
