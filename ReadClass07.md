This topic is important how learning different ways of network connectivity helps me decide which method to connect my network in a secure way. How to safely transfer information or files from RDP between my client and server through the network.

# ***SSH Protocol***

## What is the Secure Shell (SSH) Protocol?
- SSG Protocol also refered as Secure Shell is a method for secure remote login from one computer to another and provides many different options for a strong authentication. It protech communications integrity and security with strong encryption. 
- Also a secure alternative to the non-protected login protocols such as rlogin, telnet, and insecure file transder methods such as FTP.

## What are the typical uses of the SSH protocol?
- In corporate networks, it manages network infrastructure and other critical system components.
- It issues remote commands and interacts and automates file transfers.
- Lastly, it provides secure access for users and automated processes. 

## How does the SSH protocol work?
- The SSH protocol works in the client-server model, which means that the connection is made by the SSH client connecting to the SSH server.
- The SSH client drives the connection setup proccess and uses the public key cryptography to verify the identity of the SSH server.
- After the setup, the SSH protocol uses a strong symmetic encryption and hashing algoritms to ensure the integrity and privacy of the data that is exchanged between the client and server.        

## How is the data kept safe when transmitted between the SSH client and server?

## What is SFTP?
- SFTP stands for (SSH File Transfer Protocol) is the most widely used secure file transfer protocol as of right now.
- It runs over SSH and is documented in draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-02.
  
# ***What is RDP? And how to use it***

## What is Windows Remote Desktop Connection?
- Windows Remote Desktop Connection tool gives us the ability to connect to a remote Windows PC or Server over the local network or on the Internet.
  
## What is RDP?
- RDP stands for (Remote Desktop Protocol) and it allows remote users to see and use Windows on a device in another location.
  
## What is the RDP port number?
- RDP which is Remote Desktop Protocol operates over TCP port 3389.
