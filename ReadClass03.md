This topic matters how BIOS impacts many computers and keeps it up to date.

## What is the BIOS?
- The BIOS stands for Basic Input Output System and also referred as ROMBIOS. BIOS is a system utility software that is put in a ROM Chip as a Firmware. Its main job is to locate and load the operating system onto the main system memory (RAM) while booting.
  
## Use analogies from your previous background to explain what happens during the booting process?
- Booting is similar to starting and driving a car. When you as a driver turns the key in the ignition, the car's electrical system turns on. The BIOS is similar to a car's ignition system when it checks the hardware and allows electricity to flow through components. After doing the POST, it proceeds onto Boot Loader and Operating System where the Driver is the bootloader who takes control of the car as the operating system.
  
## What is the “Power On Self Test”?
- When I start the car, the dashboard lights shows up showing information such as fuel, oil, and possibly alerts/issues. If there is no problems then the car is ready to drive. Basically, the BIOS does a self check on hardware components and if it checks all components and indicates there are no issues then the boot process continues.
  
## What is the CMOS?
- It is a battery power RAM memory that holds and retains date, time, user settings, and other data.

## What is the CMOS battery?
- It is a (CR2032) battery that powers the CMOS. Which last around 5 years.
